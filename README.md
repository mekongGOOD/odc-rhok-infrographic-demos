##Open Development Cambodia
Open Development Cambodia (ODC) is an non-prfot organisation based in Phnom Penh Cambodia. ODC is an **Open Data** website, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. 

The Open Data movement is based on the simple premise that data collected for public interest should be publicly available to everyone to use and republish as they wish â€“ without restrictions. ODC does not promote any particular perspective, agenda or bias other than to provide objective information about Cambodia and its development.
